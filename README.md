# Youtube-automated_search
This crawler points to "https://www.youtube.com/" and it types the search text for you in the text box and also searches for it.Once the results are loaded then it will load the top most video for you and play it.Here you just have to run the python code with the search text as the argument and you can lean back and relax cause it will play the video for you......
